            <div class="right">
                <p>Software developers can get certifications to improve their skill sets and prove their capabilities. Certifications can serve as proof of a developer's dedication to a specific skill. Certifications can also be a good chance to learn something new. Developers can put certifications on their resumes and legitimize their claim for having a specific skill. There are various certifications a software developer can earn, depending on what skills they want to develop, with different levels of expertise.
                    Example: Get the Computer Security Certification from the Software Engineering Institute by the end of the year.</p>

                <h1>Learn a new technology</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <p>A software developer can learn a new technology to add to their resume. Learning new technologies can keep a software developer aware of recent trends in technology and increase their skill set. Different programming languages can use specific technologies, and having a broad range of knowledge on these technologies can help widen the career opportunities for a software developer. They can also learn about computer and technology hardware to understand computers and technology that may be helpful in a future position.
                    Example: Create a database using Hibernate ORM in the next six months.
                    4. Lead a team
                    A software developer who wants to advance their career can also focus on their work habits and technical skills. If they take on more management and leadership roles, they can make a goal concerning their team. Showing an eagerness to take on more responsibility can make them an even more significant asset to their company. If a leadership role opens, a software developer may want to make a goal concerning how to move into that role to advance their career. Developing communication and leadership styles can help software developers stand out from their peers.
                    Example: Become a team lead in the next two years.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <p>A software developer should have strong programming and coding skills, but it's also important to have strong soft skills to advance in the workplace. Soft skills can be things like:
                    Communication
                    Problem-solving
                    Creativity
                    Adaptability
                    Work ethic
                    Time management
                    Working on these skills can make you a better colleague and employee. If a developer has strong soft skills, they can be easier to work with or more productive, both of which are skills that can help them earn a promotion or a new position. By developing these skills, a software developer can strengthen their skill set, ease their workload and improve their opportunities.
                    Example: To improve time management, take 30% fewer breaks during the workday by the end of the month.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <p>A software developer can increase their professional network by meeting other people in their field. They can attend conferences, organize meetings and use social media to build their network. An extensive network can be beneficial to someone looking to advance their career because they can meet many people from different companies and get firsthand knowledge of exciting new projects. Networking can also help software developers find a mentor who can advise them, helping to advance their careers.
                    Example: Attend two software development conferences this year, and connect with at least five other software developers.</p>
